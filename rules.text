## Draw System ##

The draw system which will be used for all tests in Nexus: Auckland Awakening will be 40 Draw Pool.

This system uses a 40 card deck, from which the standard pool (attribute + skill + bonus etc.) used in the nWoD tabletop system is dealt in cards.  Every 8+ drawn is a success and the deck is re-shuffled before dealing any additional cards for “X-again” mechanics.  If “X-again” mechanics recur then the deck is NOT re-shuffled again but rather cards simply continue to be dealt until the recurrence ends.

Where an ST is present they will deal cards for tests while either player may deal for any tests where the ST is not present.  Only tests made in the presence of an ST or at least one non-cabal member will be considered binding by the STs.

## Character Creation ##

### Age ###

Currently under the age of 18: ST Team Approval
Awakened under the age of 10: ST Approval

### Type ###

Banishers, Seers of the Throne, Left-Handed Legacies: ST Approval
The Mad: Not permitted for play
Sleepwalkers: ST Approval.
Proximus: ST Approval
Second Sight Templates: Not permitted for play
Illuminates: ST Approval (Illuminates use normal Proximus character creation rules)

### Gnosis ###

Characters may start play with a Gnosis of up to 3 bought with Backgrounds at character creation or with XP.
All Gnosis increases require ST Team Approval.

### XP Allowances ###

All characters must be created without any xp as basic Mages.
Banisher characters ONLY may use the optional character creation rules in the Banishers book.

XP will be awarded during the 4 week sanctioning period according to the following standards:
Each Wednesday Night introductory session attended: up to 20xp (Magic Rules 101, WoD Combat 102, Auckland Lex Magica and Introductory Story)
Submission of background: up to 20xp
Submission of Cabal background: up to 20xp per member
Seeking Scene: up to 20xp (may be submitted in a written format, but higher standards apply)
Achievement of all 7 other allowances: 10xp

All xp allocations are at the discretion of the characters faction ST.

## Organisations ##

### “Order” Membership ###

For the purposes of this section, 'Order' refers to an Order, Ministry, Whisper or Vision. Characters can hold status in multiple Orders without restriction. 

Membership in an Order at character creation allows access to all rote specialties and Order specific rotes of that group.

Membership in a second (or more) Order entitles a character to purchase the Order's rote specialties using the rules for rote specialties as backgrounds in Banishers.  This also allows access to Order specific rotes. 

Rote specialties are not tied to particular rotes (as indicated in White Wolf's books) but are instead techniques and particular secrets practiced by the individual Orders.

### Order Status ###

Order status functions as per the rules in Mage: The Awakening, however no XP charges apply to Order status and this will be increased and decreased as appropriate by your Faction ST.

### Consilium Status ###

Consilium status functions as per the rules in Mage: The Awakening, however no XP charges apply to Consilium status and this will be increased and decreased as appropriate by your Faction ST.


### Legacies ###

Joining a Legacy requires ST Approval.

Creating a custom Legacy requires ST Team Approval. Custom Legacies do not require the  character to be the creator, but the character is treated as a legacy creator for the purpose of gnosis requirements and attainments.
Joining a sanctioned custom Legacy requires the approval of an existing member of the legacy, otherwise normal approval levels apply.
 
Characters with PC Mentors for their Legacy pay 1 XP per month to their Mentor Character for their Second and Third attainments. This is limited to 12 XP per attainment, or a total of 24 XP spent in this manner. This XP may be spent out of normal XP or Arcane XP.

A Mentor may only gain the benefit of this XP if they have actively mentored the student that month. The player of the Mentor must spend a downtime action to teach their student.

Characters inducted into a Legacy by an NPC Mentor must have the Mentor Merit. NPC Legacy Mentors with their First Attainment are a minimum of 3-dot Mentors. Each additional Attainment requires an additional dot of the Mentor Merit.  This means a Mentor with their second attainment is a 4-dot Mentor, and the Third Attainment requires a 5-dot Mentor.

Characters with an NPC Mentor do not pay their mentor XP whilst learning their attainments, that cost is reflected by the purchase of the Mentor Merit.

### Additional Legacy Rules ###

Legacies without a parent Order are considered to have the parent Order of their Order book (if from an Order book) or to have no parent Order.

Austere [Guardians of the Veil]: The Primary Arcanum for this Legacy is Matter.  

Awakening Gambit [Adamantine Arrow] 
	Spells hung with En Passant may only be instant cast, not ritual cast.
	The Second Optional Attainment works as per Shifting Sands – including activation, retained damage and detection; but the Mana cost is as per the Attainment write-up.
	The Third Optional Attainment works as follows: The PC can inquire what their dice pool would be for an action instead of taking a number of different actions – once they fail a Resolve + Composure draw or inquiry a number times equal to their Time dots they must take the last action, unless they successfully use the Second Optional Attainment as per the Attainment write up.

The Blank Badges [Free Council]:
	Not a Number fails if it is used to gain status that would require ST Approval.
	The Quiet One allows a Blank Badge to deduct the successes drawn from the Paradox severity they are about to suffer.
	 Nothing is True, Anything is Permitted adds the Blank Badge’s activation draw to the Paradox Test in the same manner as spending Mana for mitigation.

Perfected Adept [Mage: the Awakening]: The Attainments Chi Force and Perfect Body add the character’s Life dots to their attributes, not Mind dots.

Threnodists [Legacies: The Sublime]: The first Attainment of the Threnodists requires Investigation 2 rather than "Awareness 2."  

The Timori [Banishers]: Not permitted for play.

Uncrowned King [Mage: the Awakening]: The Attainment Albedo requires Gnosis 5, Mind 3. The Attainment Rubedo requires Gnosis 7 and Mind 4.

Unforgotten Scions [Mysterium]: They are considered a Left-handed Legacy and require ST Approval.

Spirits created by Eternal Dreams grow per chapter. The Spirit grows to the rank of the caster’s Mind Arcanum minus 1 and is affected by “Spells to Employ Spirits” as normal. Eternal Dreams cannot be used more than once every three months.

Wraiths of Epochs [Mysterium]: ST Team Approval.  

### Magical Traditions ###

Joining a Magical Tradition requires ST Approval.

Characters may join multiple Magical Traditions, but may only gain mechanical benefits from a number of Traditions equal to their Gnosis.

In addition to the requirements of “Awakened, Occult 2, Academics or Occult Skill Specialty representing the tradition”, each additional Tradition a character joins increases the Occult requirement by 1.

Custom Magical Traditions which do not confer mechanical benefits require ST Approval.
Custom Magical Traditions which confer mechanical benefits require ST Team Approval.

## Additional Rules ##

### Arcana ###

Creative Thaumaturgy is not available for play.  

Rote ideas may be submitted to an ST and upon approval by the ST Team will become available for play when added to the official rote library.

Archmasters and the Imperial Mysteries are not available for play.

Modifications of a spell that require advanced arcana knowledge are not cumulative. 

Resistant damage may only be self-inflicted or caused by absorbing paradox. No effect can cause resistant damage in others. Any such affects are converted to normal damage.

#### Spells to Employ Spirits ####

A Willpower point is spent for each spirit bound or otherwise controlled. This cannot be recovered until the spell ends or a Willpower dot is spent to release it.

These restrictions not apply if a spell is used in the process of purchasing a Merit such as a Fetish, Familiar or Guardian Spirit. 

#### Rotes & Spellcasting ####

Rote titles that include the name of your Faction do not require approval (Seers of the Throne, Nephandi and Banishers are considered 'Factions' for the purposes of this rule).

Rotes that include an alternative test pool based on an individual Faction do not require approval for members of that Faction and are not available to other characters.

Rote titles that include the name of a Legacy, Tradition or other non-Faction groups do not require approval for members of that group and are ST Team Approval for all other characters.

The creation of custom rotes by master level characters requires ST Team approval before the rote can be used in play. 

Custom rotes are ST Approval to learn in game from another player character.

Characters are not required to purchase separate rotes for each arcana level of a spell.  Characters that purchase the base Rote gain access to additional effects as their Arcana mastery increases.

Rotes from the Guardians of the Veil book that refer to the "Perception" Attribute use the Wits attribute instead.

#### Instant Spellcasting ####

Voluntary penalties taken by the caster using metamagic effects may not reduce the caster’s draw pool below 1, however further penalties taken after the creation of the spell (resitance traits, defense etc) may do so.
 
#### Dispel/Counterspell ####

Counterspell and dispel successes are not cumulative within the same combined casting, but may target multiple spells.

#### Limitations to Bonuses and Traits ####

No single Trait or bonus created by a spell can exceed the level of the Caster’s relevant Arcanum.  

If a player requires information from another character’s sheet (e.g. if contested, resisted, etc) to cast a spell, then their character cannot ritually cast and hold such a spell as Prepared for offensive use.

Bonuses added to an item from Arcana do not stack, only the highest bonus is applied.

#### Failed Social and Mental Tests ####

Spells are considered social or mental tests if their rote pool uses a social or mental skill, or if they are opposed by composure or resolve.

#### Sympathetic Magic ####

Any spell affecting multiple targets always uses the weakest sympathetic connection of those targets.

Penalties from Occultation and Fame apply both to all sympathetic magic.
