Location: The Nexus
===================

Located in the Shadow above Auckland, this floating Atlantean structure hovers above an area that corresponds to Auckland Hospital in the Real World. It looks like the top of a mountain that has been cut off, flipped over, and had a mass of structures built atop and within it. It appeared in its present location just prior to the formation of the Covenant in 1918, and has since acted as the primary meeting point for Covenant meetings. Countless hallways, rooms and larger chambers exist within its bounds, and despite their best attempts, the mages of Auckland have yet to explore its full extents. Travel to the Nexus can be easily achieved by passing through one of the hidden portals located in the Civic Theatre, the Downtown Ferry Building, Jubilee Hall in Newmarket, the Capitol Theatre in Balmoral, or the Pumphouse Theatre in Takapuna.
